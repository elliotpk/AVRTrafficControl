# lab5

This project was made for a course about real-time systems and was the final lab work for that course. 

The task was to, together with code from previous labs create a traffic controller for a one-way bridge. 
The traffic controller was to control two stoplights at either end of the bridge and was communicate over com-port with a car simulator on the computer end.

This was implemented on a AVR Butterfly running a ATmega169 microcontroller.
